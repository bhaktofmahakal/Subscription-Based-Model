## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer** (API Routes)
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Validates input data
   - Manages authentication and authorization
   - Routes requests to appropriate services

2. **Domain Layer** (Services)
   - Contains business logic
   - Manages subscription lifecycle
   - Handles background tasks
   - Independent of presentation and data layers

3. **Data Layer** (Models & Database)
   - Defines database schema
   - Handles data persistence
   - Provides data access methods
   - Manages relationships between entities

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling
   - Logging

## 💾 Database Schema

The database consists of three main entities:

1. **User**
   - Basic user information (email, username)
   - Authentication details (hashed_password)
   - Role information (is_admin)
   - Account status (is_active)
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

2. **Plan**
   - Plan details (name, description, features)
   - Pricing information (price)
   - Duration (duration_days)
   - Status (is_active)
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

3. **Subscription**
   - Relationships to User and Plan
   - Lifecycle information (start_date, end_date)
   - Status (ACTIVE, CANCELLED, EXPIRED)
   - Cancellation details (cancelled_at)
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

### Entity Relationships:
- A User can have multiple Subscriptions (one-to-many)
- A Plan can be associated with multiple Subscriptions (one-to-many)
- A Subscription belongs to exactly one User and one Plan (many-to-one)

## 🔄 API Design

The API follows RESTful conventions with intuitive endpoint design:

- **Resource-based URLs**: Endpoints are organized around resources (users, plans, subscriptions)
- **HTTP Methods**: Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations
- **Status Codes**: Appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- **Query Parameters**: For filtering, pagination, and sorting
- **Path Parameters**: For identifying specific resources
- **Request/Response Bodies**: Consistent JSON structure with proper validation

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**:
  - Tokens contain user ID, username, and admin status
  - Configurable token expiration
  - Secure password hashing with bcrypt

- **Role-based Authorization**:
  - Regular users can only manage their own subscriptions
  - Admin users can manage all plans and subscriptions
  - Endpoint protection with dependencies

- **Security Features**:
  - Password hashing with salt
  - Token-based authentication
  - CORS middleware configuration

## ⏱️ Subscription Lifecycle

Subscriptions follow a defined lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: User subscribes to a plan, creating an ACTIVE subscription
2. **Management**: 
   - User can upgrade/downgrade to different plans
   - Admin can view and manage all subscriptions
3. **Cancellation**: User or admin can cancel a subscription, changing status to CANCELLED
4. **Expiration**: System automatically marks subscriptions as EXPIRED when end_date is reached
5. **Renewal**: User can create a new subscription after cancellation or expiration
